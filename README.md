Simple project that turns a led if light is minimal(or absent) using a photoresistor.

# How does a photoresistor work?
Based on the amount of light it receives it's conductivity changes it's made out of cadmium sulphide tape which let's photons pass through, when light is absent or very minimal the photoresistor can have a resistance up to several MΩ (Mega-OHM's) but when there is light it drops down to 100Ω(might vary).
